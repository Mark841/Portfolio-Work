The Main.java file is the one used to run the program.

NOTE: In the search stores menu, it returns the first search result on each site, this is because the first result 
is normally the most relevant. At a later date I could use an algorithm to make it more accurate 
and find the most suitable result, but for the time being it is sufficient. The Epic store for some 
reason sometimes works and sometimes doesn't work, I have been unable to figure out why this occurs.

NOTE: The origin website does not allow me to query it, as the HTML appears hidden and I cannot 
access the contents of the page. It also is laid out over 3 different pages to get the price of 
the game and is very difficult to try and get. The blizzard store cannot be searched online, it 
is only through the store application and therefore no results can be used.
