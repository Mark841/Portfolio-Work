The Main.java file is the one used to run the program. Processing time may vary on different computers, 
I have only tested it on my own computer.

NOTE: In the search stores menu, it returns the first search result on each site, this is because the first result 
is normally the most relevant. At a later date I could use an algorithm to make it more accurate 
and find the most suitable result, but for the time being it is sufficient. The Epic store for some 
reason sometimes works and sometimes doesn't work, I have been unable to figure out why this occurs.
This can be seen in the video example of the program running where it does not show that "Assassin's Creed Odyssey" 
isn't on the store even though it is, it appears randomly on different runs of the program. Also Anno 
shows up as a ubisoft result for "Assassin's creed" this is because it shows up as the first result 
on ubisofts website for that search.

NOTE: The origin website does not allow me to query it, as the HTML appears hidden and I cannot 
access the contents of the page. It also is laid out over 3 different pages to get the price of 
the game and is very difficult to try and get. The blizzard store cannot be searched online, it 
is only through the store application and therefore no results can be used.
