This is an edited version of the snake I coded for the Snake with SQL project, I decided to test my abilities and see if I could make snake
run by itself. I have incorporated several new functions that attempt to make the snake: avoid the AI, avoid going over itself and also avoid 
going off the screen/board, all of these happen while it is also trying to go after the raspberry/score. Note the AI snake only catches the 
'player' snake if it catches its head/front and not the other parts/segments of the snake.
