This project will only work on Raspberry Pi's as it requires some libraries that are on there. It also requires specific hardware to run optimally as it was designed for that, 
these include specific wirings to rotary encoders and a 5 inch display. It also requires the pygame library which is available at the link:

The media in the Project Development folder demonstrates the project throughout its development and changes made. These are not direct screen captures as it was worked on in a Raspberry Pi 
so that option was unavialable, thus the quality of these media is not to as high a standard as it could be.

This project could be improved by using classes instead of just functions
This project is also unfinished and a work in progress
