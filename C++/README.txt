The files for the game engine and game are in the 2D_GameEngine folder.

The map.map file contains the coordinates for each tile from the tile map, there are 2 layers as one gives the visuals of the map 
and the other layer states where collisions should happen and the player isn't allowed to move past.

The project has been worked on in Visual Studio, with it set to x86 not x64. Multiple properties had to be edited such as setting 
an input linker and adding dependencies to the SDL2 library.

To learn C++ I started with teaching myself the basic commands and adapting my knowledge of other languages to develop a basic 
understanding of the language and how to implement key concepts. To further my knowledge and ability I found a library that 
contains lots of classes and functions that can be used to help create games (SDL2). I followed tutorials on how to use this library, 
create 2D pixel art and animations and also a tutorial on how to create a tilemap that can be used by the game to create the map.

This project is still a work in progress, it is just moving slower now as I have started a new semester at university. The game
running so far can be seen in the "Game Running Videos" folder where there are screen recordings of the game running.



When I finish this project I intend to develop a new game but in a different genre, this will try and prevent having many 
similarities between the code. This will allow me to adapt my knowledge and the skills I have learnt from the tutorials to become 
more competent with C++ and also deepen my knowledge and understanding of how to create a game.
